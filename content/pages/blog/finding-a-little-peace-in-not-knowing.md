  For most of my life, I thought the goal was to know everything: what my
  partner is thinking, what my boss wants, how the money will work out. This is
  about the peace I've found in admitting I don't.

For most of my life, I thought the goal was to know\....

> Know what my boss wants. 
> Know how the money will work out. 
> Know what my partner is thinking.
> Know exactly who I am and where I’m going.

If I didn’t know, it felt like I was failing. The moment there was a gap in the
story, my brain rushed to fill it in: 

> “If I don’t know... something bad 
>
> **is**
>
>  hiding in there.”

That worked just well enough to keep me hooked. Overthinking got me ahead in school,
helped me survive chaotic jobs, and kept me sharp in rooms where no one was
going to slow down and explain things twice. But it also meant my nervous
system lived on a permanent red alert. I wasn’t just living my life; I was
constantly running predictions about everyone else’s.

Lately, I’ve been living inside a different sentence:

> **"If you know nothing, you may already know all you need to start."**


I wrote that line on a day when my mind was spinning out every worst-case
scenario at once—about love, money, work, friends, all of it. It landed like a
hard reset. If I truly “know nothing” about how this ends, then the only thing
that matters is: 

> "What do I want to do next, from 
>
> **who I am**
>
>  right now?"

That’s become the ground I stand on when my brain starts telling very confident
stories with zero actual evidence. It doesn’t silence the anxiety, but it gives
me a place to put my feet.


Love: From mind-reading to sharing a mind
-----------------------------------------



When someone I love pulls back, gets quiet, or feels “off,” my brain used to treat
that like an alarm going off in a control room.

I could be sitting on the couch after a long day, my phone on the table, and I’d
notice one slightly different tone in a text. A slower reply. A shorter
sentence. A period where there’s usually an emoji. My stomach would drop like
I’d just gotten a certified letter from the universe.

The story sounded like this: 

> “I know what this means. They’re mad. I messed up. They’re going to leave.”

Once that story locked in, I’d go into damage-control mode. I’d start explaining
everything—where I was, why I did that thing, what I meant by that joke. I’d
replay the week and stack up timelines in my head: “No, see, at 7:42 p.m. I
texted you this, which proves I wasn’t doing that.” I was trying to win a case
that no one had actually opened.

What I almost never did was pause long enough to ask what was really going on. 
I’m learning to replace that panic-story with a different sentence:

> “I don’t know what this means yet. I only know that I care, and I
> want to understand with them, not in my head alone.”

That tiny shift changes everything. It takes the pressure off me to be a psychic,
and it takes the pressure off them to be perfectly transparent before they’re
ready. Accusation turns into curiosity. Defense turns into listening.
Mind-reading turns into an actual conversation with a real human in front of
me, not the version I invented in my head.

Very practically, this looks like doing small, unheroic things differently. Instead
of sending three long paragraphs trying to pre-defend myself, I send one honest
message:

> “Hey, I’m feeling a little distance and my brain wants to make up stories. Are you
> okay? Is there anything I’m missing?”

Instead of disappearing into my own shame when I mess up, I say:

> “I see how that landed. I get why that hurt. I want to understand more so I don’t keep
> doing the same thing.”

I don’t have to solve the entire relationship in my head. I just have to care
enough to show up, ask, and listen, even if the answer isn’t comfortable. *That’s
what love looks like on actual Tuesday nights;* it's not big speeches or perfect
certainty, just two people willing to admit they don’t fully know each other
yet and are still choosing to try.



## Work: From over-delivering to honest boundaries

My work brain is wired like this:


> “If I’m not over-delivering, they’ll realize I’m not enough.”

It’s sneaky, because on the outside it looks like ambition and strong work ethic. Say yes to the extra project. Answer emails late. Be the person who “can take it.” Be the one who figures it out when no one else knows where to start. That stuff gets rewarded. Promotions, good feedback, people saying, “We’re so glad you’re on this.”

Underneath is a quieter fear:

>
> “If I ever stop operating at emergency speed, they’ll see I’m just a regular person and decide I’m replaceable.”

So I say yes too quickly. I carry things alone instead of pushing for clearer ownership. 
I try to compensate for chaos and unclear expectations by grinding harder, 
as if more hours and more stress can fix broken structure.

The quiet fear is simple: if I slow down, or say “this isn’t workable,” 
people will see through me and decide I don’t deserve the seat I’m in.

But the truth is, I don’t actually know that. I don’t get to skip ahead and read their minds or predict their reaction with 100% accuracy. 
I only know how I feel when I’m constantly running on fumes: 

> *realizing the resentment, disconnection from the work I genuinely care about,
> and one more emergency away from shutting down.*

So I’m starting to ask a different question:

What if I admit I don’t know and say what I actually need?

That doesn’t mean storming into meetings and flipping tables. It means starting with sentences that are both honest and specific:

> “Here’s what I can realistically deliver by that date.”
> “I’m not clear on the priority here; can we line that up so I know what to tackle first?”
> “I want to do this well. Here’s what I’d need to make that happen without burning out.”

Sometimes the answer is understanding and support. Sometimes it’s awkward. Sometimes it reveals that the environment really does expect constant over-functioning, and then I have decisions to make about whether that’s sustainable for me.

But either way, it’s real. It’s me interacting with what’s actually happening instead of my worst-case version.

The practice, for me, is learning that “not heroic, not perfect, just honest” is allowed to be enough at work. I don’t have to prove my worth by breaking myself. I can admit I don’t know how much is “enough” to everyone else and instead define what “enough” looks like for a healthy, human version of me.

## Money: From shame to one honest question a week

Money is one of the loudest places my brain tries to hand me verdicts.

> “If I was really as smart as I say I am, I’d have this solved.”

That line shows up when I look at my accounts and don’t like the numbers, when debt feels heavy, when life costs more than I expected it to, when I start dreaming about a future that requires more financial stability than I currently have.

The verdict doesn’t help. It doesn’t make me richer or more disciplined. It just makes me ashamed and stuck. Shame is great at paralyzing you and terrible at helping you plan.

So I’ve started working with a smaller, more practical question:

What is one thing I don’t know about my money that I could find out this week?

Not:

>  “How do I magically fix everything by Friday?”

 Just: 

> "What is one blind spot I can turn into a number or a fact."

Sometimes that looks like actually pulling the transactions and facing how much went to eating out and “little” purchases that don’t feel like a big deal in the moment. Sometimes it’s figuring out my true monthly baseline cost of living, not the fantasy number in my head. Sometimes it’s sitting down and defining what “stable” even means for me in dollars instead of vibes: stable for me might be “this amount in savings,” or “this ratio of fixed costs to income,” or “this amount of debt paid down.”

The funny thing is, the numbers themselves are often less terrifying than the fog of not looking at them. Each time I turn one piece of fog into something measurable, my nervous system calms down a notch. I might not like the answer, but at least I’m in a real conversation with my life instead of fighting a shadow.

I don’t have to become a financial superhero overnight. I just have to move from vague dread to one clearer piece of reality at a time. Peace, in this part of my life, doesn’t come from having everything handled; it comes from not being afraid to look and then letting the numbers inform one small next move.

## Friendship: From carrying people to standing beside them

Friendship is where a lot of this gets tested in real time.

I’ve been the friend who opens the door, clears off the couch, and says, “Stay as long as you need.” I’ve been the one who takes the late-night call, frontloads the ride, picks up the tab, says, “Don’t worry about it, I’ve got you,” even when I’m not completely sure I do.

On the surface, that looks generous. Underneath, there’s a quiet belief

>
> “If I really care about people, I should be willing to carry more.”

More of the bill. More of the planning. More of the emotional weight. More of the fallout when life blows up. There’s also a part of me that likes being that person—the older one, the steady one, the “I can handle it” one. It makes me feel useful, needed, and in control.

What I don’t always admit is the second voice under that:

>
> “If I keep carrying everyone, there might not be enough left of me.”

My brain likes to pretend it knows the script in friendship too.

>
> “If I say what I need, they’ll disappear.”
> “If I stop helping so much, they’ll think I never cared.”
> “If I set a line, I’ll lose the whole world that comes with them.”

The truth is, I don’t know any of that. I don’t know who will grow, who will drift, who will surprise me. All I really know is how it feels to keep swallowing my own needs so no one gets uncomfortable: heavy, lonely, and quietly angry.

So I come back to a simpler question:

>
> What kind of friend am I actually trying to be?

I want to be someone who shows up when things get hard, not someone who ghosts the second it’s inconvenient. I want to be someone who tells the truth about what I can and can’t do, not someone who smiles and then resents you from the other room. I want to be someone who can love people without disappearing inside my own life.

That means practicing sentences like:

>
> “I care about you, and I need this to be more balanced.”
> “I want you in my life, but I can’t keep doing it this way.”
> “I’m here, but I also have limits, and I need you to meet me partway.”

Those aren’t threats. They’re invitations! Towards a more equal friendship that doesn’t run on unspoken debt.

When I approach friendship from my “not knowing” philosophy, it sounds like this:

>
> “I don’t know how you’ll respond…I don’t know if this changes our relationship or deepens it. I don’t know if you’ll meet me in the middle or decide it’s too much work. What I do know is that I can’t keep loving people by erasing myself."

That’s the experiment I’m running now in friendship: less rescuing, more walking beside. Less quiet scorekeeping, more honest conversations. Less assuming I know exactly how the story ends, more paying attention to how it actually feels along the way.

Sometimes that means letting a season with someone loosen instead of forcing it to stay the same. Sometimes it means being surprised by who steps up when I finally put the weight down and ask to share it.

I can’t script who stays, who goes, or who grows. I can only decide that I’m not going to trade my peace for proximity anymore. If we’re going to be in each other’s lives, I want it to be as two whole people, standing next to each other, not one of us secretly carrying the other on our back.

## Identity: Too much and not enough, at the same time

A lot of days, it feels like I live in a contradiction:

>
> I am not enough, and too much.

Too emotional. Too intense. Too many ideas. Too many projects. Too many words. At the same time, not successful enough yet, not calm enough, not “together” enough, not what I pictured a person my age “should” look like on paper.

My brain loves to collapse all of that into a single harsh verdict. It tells me it knows exactly how other people see me: needy, chaotic, not ready, a lot. The jury in my head never needs evidence; it just points to every unfinished thing, every rough edge, every past mistake and says, “See? Case closed.”

The truth is, I don’t actually know who I am in anyone else’s head. I never have. None of us do. We see a sliver of their reactions and we build a whole mythology on top of it.

What I do know is who I want to be in this moment.

Right now, I want to be honest instead of impressive. I want to be kind instead of right. I want to be someone who is learning out loud instead of pretending I’ve already arrived.

That sounds abstract, but it turns into small choices.

It looks like admitting, “Yeah, I’m overwhelmed,” instead of faking calm and then snapping later. It looks like saying, “I don’t know enough about this yet to have a strong opinion,” when my ego wants to weigh in on everything. It looks like letting myself be excited about the things I care about, even if they don’t fit neatly into one identity—a guy who loves analytics and philosophy and pool halls and late-night conversations and building dashboards and talking about feelings.

For a long time, I treated identity like a job description I had to get perfect. One wrong line and I’d be rejected from the life I wanted. Now I’m trying to see it more like a living draft. I don’t need a final, polished definition of who I am to be allowed to exist and love people well. I can let my actions across days and weeks say, “This is who I’m becoming,” and let that matter more than any label.

I can’t control the story living in anyone else’s mind about me—how they interpret my intensity, my softness, my ambition, my confusion. I can choose how I show up in the conversation, in the room, in the relationship, in the work.

That’s where my peace is hiding: not in their opinion, which will shift anyway, but in my intention and my effort. Am I moving toward the kind of person I respect? Am I repairing when I mess up? Am I treating people, including myself, with more care this month than I did last month?

If the answer to those questions is yes more often than it’s no, then maybe I’m not as lost as my anxiety likes to claim.

Building peace, one “I don’t know” at a time

So this is where I am right now.

I don’t have my relationship life fully figured out. I still misread signals, still tell myself old stories, still get scared and say the wrong thing before I catch myself.

I don’t have work perfectly balanced. I still overcommit, still underestimate how much energy something will take, still catch myself trying to earn my chair at the table by running myself into the ground.

I don’t have a flawless financial plan or a locked-in identity. There are still unknowns, debts, goals I haven’t hit yet, and questions I don’t have tidy answers for. I don’t always know how friendship and loyalty are supposed to look in the long run, where the line is between sticking it out and admitting something isn’t working anymore.

> I’m learning that not knowing doesn’t mean I’m lost.
>  It means I’m honest.

 And honesty, it turns out, is a surprisingly solid place to build from...

Honesty is enough to start a real talk instead of a silent spiral

> “Here’s what my brain is telling me, and here’s what I’m actually afraid of.” 

It’s enough to start a clearer boundary instead of quiet resentment

> “I want to keep showing up, but I need it to look different if I’m going to stay well.” 

It’s enough to start a simple money step instead of shame

> “This week I’m just going to figure out this one number and make one decision from it.” 

It’s enough to start a chosen way of being instead of a borrowed label

> “This is who I’m trying to be today, whether or not everyone else agrees.”



If you know nothing, you may already know all you need to start. You don’t have to know the ending to take the next honest step. You don’t have to be certain to be sincere. You don’t have to have your whole life mapped out to say:

> “I care about the people around me, I care about myself, and I’m willing to learn how to do both better.”

Right now, what I know is this: I care. I want to understand with people, not alone in my head. I want to keep building love and peace one imperfect day at a time, even if I never get to feel like I “know it all.”

## **That’s enough to start.**
