      Alexander Floyd Glenn is a Business Intelligence Solutions Engineer who
      lives at the intersection of bank-scale data, AI, and human stories. He
      grew up inside the real world of lending and credit—not just the
      spreadsheets about it—working across sales floors, call centers, and
      operations before moving into BI engineering for a national bank. That
      path means he doesn’t just see rows and columns; he sees quotas,
      regulatory exams, servicing headaches, and the very human pressure around
      approvals, denials, and growth targets. When he writes or builds an
      analytic, he’s thinking about the person who has to rely on it at 8:00
      a.m. on a Monday.


      As an author, Alexander focuses on the modern BI stack as it actually
      shows up in the field: messy operational data, high-stakes decisions, and
      teams under pressure. He writes about data modeling and SQL, Tableau and
      Power BI, Excel/Power Query/DAX, and the growing role of AI in analytics.
      His work moves from raw schemas and pipelines, into time-intelligence and
      credit-risk measures, and finally into dashboards, scorecards, and
      workflows that leaders actually use. The throughline is practical: clear
      patterns, reusable designs, and honest post-mortems from BI projects in
      lending, call-center science, and consumer finance.


      Because he started on the business side, Alexander is comfortable sitting
      down with stakeholders, asking “why” until the real problem surfaces, and
      then translating that into data models, semantic layers, and reporting
      systems. He thinks in systems: pipelines, governance, and security on one
      side; behavior, incentives, and adoption on the other. In both his
      engineering work and his writing, he’s drawn to the full
      lifecycle—requirements, modeling, build, rollout, and enablement—and to
      being the person who can talk architecture with IT and plain language with
      a frontline manager in the same afternoon.


      Outside banking and BI, Alexander serves on the board of a nonprofit art
      gallery in Flint, Michigan. That work keeps him close to design,
      community, and storytelling, and it heavily influences how he approaches
      data products on the page and on the screen. Whether he’s curating a
      gallery show or a dashboard layout, he cares about how information feels:
      intuitive, visually clear, and honest about uncertainty and tradeoffs. His
      writing often weaves those worlds together—analytics, design, and lived
      experience—into case studies and essays about how data can support real
      people instead of overwhelming them.


      Alexander is actively open to contract, consulting, and full-time
      opportunities where he can help shape or own the BI stack: standing up
      analytics for growing companies, modernizing reporting for established
      organizations, or building specialized dashboards and data products for
      specific teams. He’s based in Michigan, fully comfortable with remote
      work, and happy to travel on-site for discovery workshops, stakeholder
      interviews, whiteboard sessions, and go-live support.


      On this site, you’ll find his portfolio of dashboards, models, and
      articles—an evolving library of patterns, hard-won lessons, and
      experiments at the edge of BI and AI. If you’re looking for someone who
      can bridge business and data, design and engineering, and you want
      analytics that people actually use, you can reach him through the contact
      form on this site or connect with him on LinkedIn.
